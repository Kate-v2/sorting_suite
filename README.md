**Sorting Algorithms implemented in JavaScript.**

Using Javascript, Node.js, Mocha, & Chai, this small application successfully uses recursion to do a Merge Sort of variously sized arrays of integers.

* This algorithm is tested - run `mocha test/merge_sort_test.js.`
* There is no run file for interaction, the test demonstrates the JS module functionality.
* node_modules contains files associated with testing library `chai` and debugging tool `pryjs`.
