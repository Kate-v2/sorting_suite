Assignment: http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html

* Complete Sorting Suite in Javascript here. 
* Choose one out of the three fundamental sorting algorithms to complete.
* Use Node.js to run your code, and Mocha/Chai to write your tests.
* FE2 gets this as a project, so we’ll use their project requirements,  but you can ignore the rubric. You won’t be graded.
* We just want you to get some practice testing and writing JavaScript.
